//         A GET request to the base URL should list all the charging stations in the city.
//
//        A GET request to /show/:id should respond to single charging station details.
//
//        A POST request to / should add charging station details to the database.
//
//        A PUT request to /:id/edit, changes the appropriate details in the database.
//
//        A DELETE request to /delete/:id should delete that particular charging station from the database.


A GET request to /?limit=10, should return only 10 entries.
A GET request to /?sort=asc&param= station_pricing, should sort the EV charging station based on pricing (param value)
